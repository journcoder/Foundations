    "## Tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "- An API ENDPOINT is basically just the URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you get an error using an API, just stick the API call URL in the browser and see what you get.\n",
    "If your error says \"developer inactive,\" probably something's wrong with your api key.\n",
    "\n",
    "##PAGINATION:\n",
    "\n",
    "- So APIs often don't return everything they find (If they did, an API call that has a huge result might bring down their service). Instead, they only return 10 or 20 or some number at a time. \n",
    "\n",
    "- So once you get the first 10 (or 20 or whatever) items, you can get the next 10 (or 20 or whatever) by telling the API to skip the first 10 (or 20 or whatever) and to give you the next 10 (or 20 or whatever).\n",
    "\n",
    "**There are usually 2 ways you can tell an API to skip a certain number of items:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-You specify an OFFSET, the number of items that you skip, or you specify a PAGE, the number of pages that you skip, where each page has 10 (or 20 or whatever) items.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the New York Times API, the Articles API makes you specify a `page` parameter and the Books API makes you specify a `offset` parameter.\n",
